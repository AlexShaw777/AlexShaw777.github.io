                    <h2 id = "contact">One of my first big projects our group was tasked with was the adaption of a car traffic simulator. We were given a basic 
                        layout of the traffic intersection and had to make sure there were no crashes in the intersection just like in real life. 
                        This project took a lot of hard work and dedication that showed when we did finally execute and run our final result. 
                        A snapshot of the result is above.

                        I appreciate this project because it gave me a deeper meaning behind such a non-trivial idea.
                        I said to myself that if an intersection has so many extremities and variables then I can only
                        begin to imagine the circumstances of harder and more complicated problems. This moment was the spark 
                        of my passion and chase of Computer Science.
