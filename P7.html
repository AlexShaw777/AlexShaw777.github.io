                    I am a Senior at the <a id ="URlink" href = "https://www.richmond.edu/">University of Richmond</a> and 
                    I am studying the complex field of <b>Computer Science with a 
                    concentration in Data Statistics and Analysis</b> while minoring in Business Administration.
                    I am based in Richmond, Virginia and am willing to relocate across the nation.
                    <!-- I have my resume here <span title ="Click to download."><a href="C:\Users\alexs\OneDrive\Desktop\Me\Resume2.pdf" id ="resume">attached</a></span>.  -->
                    My main passion when considering work is how can I help people using my skillset. 
                    Now that I have coding and critical decsion making in my toolbox, I can solve any problem that blocks my goal which is to help.
                    Coding has been such a technologcial revolution that has and will continue to project our society to new accomplishments. 
                    I would love to be part of a company that seeks this.
