                    <h3>Simulates the complexities of traffic and when to turn</h3>
                    <!-- <p>One of my first big projects our group was tasked with was the adaption of a car traffic simulator. We were given a basic 
                        layout of the traffic intersection and had to make sure there were no crashes in the intersection just like in real life. 
                        This project took a lot of hard work and dedication that showed when we did finally execute and run our final result. 
                        A snapshot of the result is above.
