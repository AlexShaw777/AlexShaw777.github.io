            <p>For this project, we had to explore different datasets based
                on our interests, choose a dataset to work with, visualize and
                understand the dataset, and then decide on a problem we
                want to explore. We had to do data cleaning, data visualization, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction if applicable,
                correlations, supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
                We took these requirements and decided to dive deep into a
                problem statement that requires large and interesting datasets
                to analyze. Some datasets to select came from OpenML,
                Kaggle, UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, TensorFlow
                Datasets and Wikipediaâ€™s List. We, as a group, chose Kaggle
                due to its ease of use and effective data cleaning. We at the
                time did not know of how well Kaggle cleans its data until
                after we went through our data cleaning process. Our timeline
                was to prepare a proposal by March 16th, 2023 that gave a
                high level description of our plan on how we are going to
                accomplish this task. A project progress checkup was done
                on March 31, 2023 and helped our group move in a better
                direction. This final project presentation is due on April 26,
                2023 which will include a presentation slide deck, this project
                report, code files and a team evaluation document.
